Beef and red wine are a classic combination. Generally, leaner cuts of beef go well with light or medium-bodied reds, such as pinot noir or merlot, while fattier cuts can handle a bold red, such as cabernet sauvingnon. The King Estate Domaine Pinot Noir with a 4.6 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 50 dollars per bottle.","productMatches":[{"id":456149,"title":"King Estate Domaine Pinot Noir","description":"","price":"$49.99","imageUrl":"https://spoonacular.com/productImages/456149-312x231.jpg","averageRating":0.9199999999999999,"ratingCount":5.0,"score":0.8574999999999999,"link":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=*QCiIS6t4gA&mid=2025&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wine.com%2Fproduct%2Fking-estate-domaine-pinot-noir-2001%2F83897"}]},"instructions":"<ol><li>To make the rub, combine the 1/2 cup red wine, ancho powder, ground espresso, paprika, dry mustard, salt, pepper, ground coriander, garlic powder, dried oregano, and dried ginger in a small bowl and whisk until they form a paste. </li><li>Place the roast in a large zipper food storage bag. </li><li>Slather the roast with the paste. </li><li>Press as much air as possible out of the bag and seal tight. </li><li>Refrigerate overnight. </li><li>The next day, let the roast come to room temperature for about an hour before roasting.</li><li>Heat your oven to 450F.</li><li>Place your roast in a roasting pan on a rack, fat side up. </li><li>Insert an oven thermometer into the thickest part, making sure that the tip is placed firmly into the meat, not in fat or against bone.</li><li>Roast in your oven for 15 minutes.</li><li>Reduce heat to 325F. </li><li>Roast for about 2 more hours or until the thermometer reads 135-140 degrees for medium.</li><li>Transfer the roast to a platter and allow it to rest for 15 minutes before carving. </li><li>To make the gravy, skim off the excess fat and then place your roasting pan over your stove burner. </li><li>Add 1/2 cup of red wine and 2 cups of beef broth and whisk over medium heat until it comes to a boil. </li><li>Whisk together 1/2 cup water and 3 tablespoons of cornstarch in a small bowl. </li><li>Add this mixture to the pan and whisk while the gravy thickens, about 5 minutes.</li><li>Slice the roast and serve with the rich gravy.<span class=\"html-tag\"></span></li></ol><span class=\"html-tag\"></span>","analyzedInstructions":[{"name":"","steps":[{"number":1,"step":"To make the rub, combine the 1/2 cup red wine, ancho powder, ground espresso, paprika, dry mustard, salt, pepper, ground coriander, garlic powder, dried oregano, and dried ginger in a small bowl and whisk until they form a paste.","ingredients":[{"id":1002013,"name":"ground coriander","localizedName":"ground coriander","image":"ground-coriander.jpg"},{"id":10193715,"name":"ground espresso","localizedName":"ground espresso","image":"instant-coffee-or-instant-espresso.png"},{"id":0,"name":"dried oregano","localizedName":"dried oregano","image":"oregano.jpg"},{"id":1022020,"name":"garlic powder","localizedName":"garlic powder","image":"garlic-powder.png"},{"id":2021,"name":"ginger powder","localizedName":"ginger powder","image":"ginger.png"},{"id":1002024,"name":"mustard powder","localizedName":"mustard powder","image":"dry-mustard.jpg"},{"id":14096,"name":"red wine","localizedName":"red wine","image":"red-wine.jpg"},{"id":2028,"name":"paprika","localizedName":"paprika","image":"paprika.jpg"},{"id":1002030,"name":"pepper","localizedName":"pepper","image":"pepper.jpg"},{"id":2047,"name":"salt","localizedName":"salt","image":"salt.jpg"},{"id":1012034,"name":"dry seasoning rub","localizedName":"dry seasoning rub","image":"seasoning.png"}],"equipment":[{"id":404661,"name":"whisk","localizedName":"whisk","image":"whisk.png"},{"id":404783,"name":"bowl","localizedName":"bowl","image":"bowl.jpg"}]},{"number":2,"step":"Place the roast in a large zipper food storage bag.
